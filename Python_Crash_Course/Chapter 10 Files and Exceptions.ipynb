    "Now that we have mastered the basic skills of python that we need to write proper, organised programs. It is time to think about making our programs even more relevent and usable. In this chapter we will learn to work with files so our programs can quickly analyse lots and lots of data. We will learn how to handle errors so our programs don't crash when they encounter unexpected issues. We will learn about expectations which are special objects that python creates to manage errors that arise while a progarm is running. We will also learn about 'json' module that allows us to save user data so it isn't lost when our program stops running. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to work with files that save data will make our programs easier for people to use. Users will be able to choose what data to enter and when to enter it. People can run our program, do some work, then close the program with the ability to open the file later and pick up where they left off. Learning to handle expections will help us deal with situation in which files don't exist and deal with other problems that can cause our program to crash. This will make our programs a lot more robust when they encounter issues and bad data, either through a innocent mistake or a deliberate attempt to break the programs. With the skills we learn in this chapter we will make our programs more \n",

    "An incredible amount of data is available to use through text files. Text files can contain data such as weather, traffic, socioeconomic, literary and more! Reading from a file is particular useful in data analysis applications, but it is also applicable to any situations in which you want to analyse data or modify information in a file. For example we can write a program that reads the contents of a txt file and rewrite the file with formatting that allows a browser to display it. When we want to work with the information in a text file, the first step is to read the file into memory. You can read the entire contents of a file, or you can work through one the file one line at a time. \n",

    "Here we are, this is a bit complex so lets run through it! First we use the open() function. To do any work with a file, even just printing its components, we first need to use 'open' to access it. The open() function needs ONE arguement: the name of the file you want to open. Python looks for this file in the directory where the program that is running is being stored. In the example above, the program goes into the homework directory and loops for pi_digits.txt. Here open('pi_digits.txt') returns an object that represents pi_digits.txt. Python assigns this object to file_object that we will work with later on. \n",

    "The keyword 'with' closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. Notice how we call open() in this program but not close(). You could open and close a file by calling open() and close(), but if a bug in your program prevents the close() method from being executed, our file will never be able to close. This may seem trivial, but improperly closed files can cause data to be lost or corrupted, or if we call the close() function too early in our program we will find ourselfs trying to work in a closed file accidentally which will lead to more errors. Structuring our code like this allows python to handle this for us, we will trust python with opening the file, then closing it at the appropiate time (when the code block is finished running).\n",

    "Once we have a file object representing pi_digits.txt, we use the read() method to read the entire contents of the document and stores it in one long string called contents (we assign it to contents) we then print the value of contents in the last line of code. \n",
