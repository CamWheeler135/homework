    "One of the most effective ways to program is to use object oriented programming. In object oriented programming we use classes that represent real world things and situations, as we 'create' objects based on these classes. When we write a class, we define the general behaviour that a whole catagory of objects can have.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we create objects from the class, the object automatically has the properties attached to it. It is amazing how well real world situations can be modelling with object oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making an object is called an instantiation and we can work with instances of a class. In the coming chapter we will wirte classes, and create instances of those classes. We will specify what kind of information can be stored in instances and we will define actions that can be taken with these instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also wrtie classes that extend the functionality of existing classes so that similar classes can share code efficiently. We will store classes in modules and learn to import classes written by other programmers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how object oriented programming works will help us see the world as a programmer does, and it will help us understand our code, not just line by line but as an averall concept. Knowing how classes world will develop our ability to think logically "

    "### The __init__ Method( ).\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that is part of a class is called a 'method' (so no longer called a function anymore.) Everything we have learned in the last chapter can be applied here in classes as well, the only difference is that we call it a method. The '__init__' method that we see in the code above is a special kind of method that Python runs automatically when we create a new instance based on the class Dog. Make sure we use two underscores at all times!!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the init method to have three parameters, self, name and age. The 'self' parameter comes first and is requried in the method definition. The self parameter must be included in the definition of the method as when we come to create some instances of the class Dog, Python will call this method. When we call the method, the self argument will automatically be passed. Every method call will automatically pass the self argument which is a reference to 'itself', meaning it gives the induvidual instance access to the attributes and methods inside of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when we make an instance of 'Dog', python will call the '__init__' method from the Dog class and we will pass Dog() a name and an age as arguments (remeber that self if passed automatically so we don't need to pass it explicitly) we only need to provide the values for the last two parameters name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also see that there are two varibles defined under the init method, these two varibles are prefixed with self. Any varible prefixed with self means it is available to every method inside of the class, and we will also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. The line 'self.name = name' takes the value associated with the parameter name and assigns it to the variable name... which is then attached to the instance being created. The same thing happens with self.age = age. Variables that can be accessed through instancs are called 'attributes'\n",
    "\n",
    "The class Dog also has two other methods (functions). Because these methods do not need any additional information than the first init method, we must define them with the parameter 'self'. The instances we create later will have access to these methods as they have the self parameter, meaning the instances will be able to sit and roll over. Although the last two methods don't really do anything, these concepts we are learing can be extended to complex situations for example the method might contain code that actaully simulates a dog rolling over in a game, or control a robot.

    "As we begin to model more and more complex things like electric cars, we will soon have to wrestle with interesting questions, such as, is the range of an electric car a property of the car or the battery??? If we are only describing one car, its probably fine to maintain the assocation of the method get_range() with the Battery class. But if we are describing a whole range of cars it would be smart to move the get_range() method into the ElectricCar class. The get_range() method wil still check the battery size before determining the range, but it would report a range specific to the kind of car its associted with. We could also keep the code for get range in the Battery class but pass the variable car_model into it so the get_range() method will return a range value based on the model of the car. \n",

    "This step brings us to an interesting point in our journey to becoming a programmer!!! When we are thinking about things like this in a problem this means we are thinking on a much higher level than just on a raw syntax level, this will develop with time as we learn to think more and more like a programmer. When we are no longer thinking about python, but how to model the real world in our code! When we reach this point, there are often no right or wrong approaches, but there are some more efficient approaches than others, but it takes practice to find these. If the code works how we want it to, GREAT! Now go back and see if we can make it more efficient! In the quest to write accurate, efficient code, everyone goes through this process."

Class na,es shpuld be written in CamelCase, to do this we have to capitalise the first letter of every single word in the class title and NOT use underscores to space the words out. Every class should have a docstring following it with a brief description of what the class does, and you should follow the same formatting conventions as we have spoken about in functions.\n",
