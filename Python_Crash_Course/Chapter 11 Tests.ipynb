    "When you write a function or a class, you an also write tests for that code to ensure that it is working correctly. When you write tests, you can be confident that our code will work correctly as more people begin to use our programs. You will also be able to test new case as you add it to make sure that our changes do not break anything. Every programmer makes mistakes, so every programmer must test their code often. In this chapter we are learning how to test our code in Pythons *unittest* module. We will learn how to build test cases, and check that a set of inputs results in the output that we want. We will see what passing a test looks like, and how failing a test can help us improve our code. We will also learn how to test functions and classes. "

A test case is a collection of unit tests that together prove that the function is doing what it is supposed to be doing. A good test case considers all of the possible inputs a function could receive. A test case with full coverage contains all of the unit tests that tests every way a function can be used. Achieving full coverage on a large project can be daunting. It is often good enough to write tests for the codes critical behavior and then aim for full coverage only if the project starts to see widespread usage. \n",

To write a test case for a function, we need to import the unittest module and the function we want to test. Then we create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase, and write a series of methods to test different aspects of the functions behavior. \n",
