    "When you write a function or a class, you an also write tests for that code to ensure that it is working correctly. When you write tests, you can be confident that our code will work correctly as more people begin to use our programs. You will also be able to test new case as you add it to make sure that our changes do not break anything. Every programmer makes mistakes, so every programmer must test their code often. In this chapter we are learning how to test our code in Pythons *unittest* module. We will learn how to build test cases, and check that a set of inputs results in the output that we want. We will see what passing a test looks like, and how failing a test can help us improve our code. We will also learn how to test functions and classes. "

A good test case considers all of the possible inputs a function could receive. A test case with full coverage contains all of the unit tests that tests every way a function can be used. Achieving full coverage on a large project can be daunting. It is often good enough to write tests for the codes critical behavior and then aim for full coverage only if the project starts to see widespread usage. \n",

To write a test case for a function, we need to import the unittest module and the function we want to test. Then we create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase, and write a series of methods to test different aspects of the functions behavior. \n",

    "In this chapter we have learned to write tests for functions and classes using tools in the unittest module that Python offers us. We learned to write a class that inherits from the unittest.TestCase class and write methods that allow us to verify specific behavior of functions. We learned to use the setUp() method that allows us to make our testing more efficient as it creates instances and attributes that can be used for all of the testing. Testing is an important topic as when our code gets more and more complex it becomes more important that we can test the behavior of our code. Become familiar with the process of testing, it is a valuable skill to have, other programmers respect that fact that our code will have testing with it, it also allows them to experiment with the code and check what they are doing more easily.
