# Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow
## Concepts, Tools and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems


In this repo I am going through the hands on machine learning book in order to develop my theoretical and pratical machine learning understanding while also developing my programming. I am going through chapter by chapter, first reading, then booting up my computer and making notes! Finally I will be working with a jupyter notebook on each chapter, doing the task set at the end to cement my understanding. These tasks are added here!

Enjoy the read!
