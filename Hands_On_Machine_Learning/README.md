# Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow
## Concepts, Tools and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems


In this repo I am going through the hands on machine learning book in order to develop my theoretical machine learning understanding while also developing my programming. I am going through chapter by chapter, first reading, then booting up my computer and working with a jupyter notebook on each chapter, adding the text and the examples the author provides. I will also be doing the task set at the end of the chapter to cement my understanding. 

Enjoy the read!
