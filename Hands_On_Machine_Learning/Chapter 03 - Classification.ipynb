    "# Chapter 03 - Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first chapter the author mentioned that the most common form of supervised learning tasks are regression (where we are prediciting continuous variables) and classification (prediciting classes). In the previous chapter we explored a regression task, where we looked at prediciting the house prices using several types of algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees and random forests. In this chapter, we are going to look at classification tasks. \n",

    "### MNIST Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "For this chapter we will be using the MNIST dataset, this is a dataset of 70 thousand labelled images of handwritten numbers. The set has been studied so much that it is often called the \"hello world\" of machine learning (thinking back to when I did my first hello world when I started to learn coding). Whenever people come up with new classification algorithms, the first thing they do is test it on the MNIST dataset to see how it fairs. Anyone who does machine learning or is learning machine learning has tackled or is going to tackle this dataset at some point!!!!\n",
