To fix this issue we use FLAGS, this acts as a signal to the program too see if it should run or not, either go or stop. We can write a program that runs a long as the flag is set to true and that it stops once the flag is set to false (this is triggered by one of the statements being false). This allows Python to only really look at one variable (the flag) instead of having to check everything at the same time --> sort of having a kill switch if one thing goes wrong."

Everything we have learned in the last chapter can be applied here in classes as well, the only difference is that we call it a method. The '__init__' method that we see in the code above is a special kind of method that Python runs automatically when we create a new instance based on the class Dog. Make sure we use two underscores at all times!!!!\n",

    "We define the init method to have three parameters, self, name and age. The 'self' parameter comes first and is requried in the method definition. The self parameter must be included in the definition of the method as when we come to create some instances of the class Dog, Python will call this method. When we call the method, the self argument will automatically be passed. Every method call will automatically pass the self argument which is a reference to 'itself', meaning it gives the induvidual instance access to the attributes and methods inside of the class. \n",

Any varible prefixed with self means it is available to every method inside of the class, and we will also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. The line 'self.name = name' takes the value associated with the parameter name and assigns it to the variable name... which is then attached to the instance being created. The same thing happens with self.age = age. Variables that can be accessed through instancs are called 'attributes'\n",

The instances we create later will have access to these methods as they have the self parameter, meaning the instances will be able to sit and roll over. Although the last two methods don't really do anything, these concepts we are learing can be extended to complex situations for example the method might contain code that actaully simulates a dog rolling over in a game, or control a robot.

When python reads this line, it calls the init method in Dog with the arguments Tilda and 11.

We then do the same with ceo, when we call the init method to create the instance of fav tech company, python will look at fav_tech_compay and then find the attribute ceo that is assocaited with it (tim cook).

    "As we begin to model more and more complex things like electric cars, we will soon have to wrestle with interesting questions, such as, is the range of an electric car a property of the car or the battery??? If we are only describing one car, its probably fine to maintain the assocation of the method get_range() with the Battery class. But if we are describing a whole range of cars it would be smart to move the get_range() method into the ElectricCar class. The get_range() method wil still check the battery size before determining the range, but it would report a range specific to the kind of car its associted with. We could also keep the code for get range in the Battery class but pass the variable car_model into it so the get_range() method will return a range value based on the model of the car. \n",

When we are no longer thinking about python, but how to model the real world in our code! When we reach this point, there are often no right or wrong approaches, but there are some more efficient approaches than others, but it takes practice to find these. If the code works how we want it to, GREAT! Now go back and see if we can make it more efficient! In the quest to write accurate, efficient code, everyone goes through this process. "
